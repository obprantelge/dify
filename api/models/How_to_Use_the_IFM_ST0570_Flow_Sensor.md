# How to Use the IFM ST0570 Flow Sensor
 
The IFM ST0570 is a compact flow monitor that can measure the flow rate of liquids in pipes. It has a preset switch point that can be adjusted with a potentiometer. It has a stainless steel body and a plug and socket connection. It can operate with an AC voltage of 24 V and has a protection rating of IP 67.

In this article, we will explain how to use the IFM ST0570 flow sensor and how to download its datasheet in pdf and iso formats.
 
## Installation and Wiring
 
The IFM ST0570 flow sensor can be installed in any position on a pipe with a Â¼'' NPT process connection. The sensor should be mounted in such a way that the flow direction is parallel to the arrow on the housing. The sensor should not be exposed to direct sunlight or high temperatures.
 
The wiring of the sensor is done with a M12 connector. The sensor has four wires: brown for +24 V AC, blue for 0 V AC, black for output, and green/yellow for protective earth. The output is normally open and switches when the flow rate exceeds the switch point. The output can be connected to a relay, a PLC, or an indicator.
 
## Adjustment and Operation
 
The IFM ST0570 flow sensor has a potentiometer that can be used to adjust the switch point. The switch point is the minimum flow rate that triggers the output. The potentiometer can be accessed by removing the cover of the housing. The switch point can be set between 3 and 300 cm/s, depending on the viscosity and density of the liquid. The factory setting is 20 cm/s for water at 25 Â°C.
 
The sensor has an LED function display that indicates the status of the output and the flow rate. The LED is green when the output is off and red when the output is on. The LED flashes when the flow rate is below or above the switch point.
