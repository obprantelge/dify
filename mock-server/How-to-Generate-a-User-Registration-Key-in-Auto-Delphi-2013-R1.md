# How to Generate a User Registration Key in Auto Delphi 2013 R1
 
If you are using Auto Delphi 2013 R1 to diagnose car and truck adapters, you may need to generate a user registration key to activate the software. This key is based on asymmetric cryptography, which means that only the original developer can generate a valid key, while everybody can check that a key is valid. This way, you can prevent unauthorized use of your software and cancel support for customers who share their keys online.

As a road sportsbike, it is one of the best of its era and the first crossplane motor remains simply beautiful to use and far less aggressive than its replacement."[^3^]

> "This R1 engine fires 1,3,2,4 cylinders and the firing intervals are uneven at 270 / 180/ 90 /180 degrees. What all this means to the rider is the most linear torque possible and amazing throttle control. This engine design allows a whole new level of rider â machine communication."[^2^]

> "Fortunately there is a solution [for the firmware update problem]. I re installed Autocom/Dephi 2012/3 I copied the firmware folder from Autocom/Delphi 2013.1 in the firmware folder Autocom/Delphi 2012.3 I updated the firmware to the version of the CDP + 100251 1310 from Autocom/Delphi 2012.3 Successfully.
